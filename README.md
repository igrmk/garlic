Tips for working on plain air
-----------------------------

1. Wear dark.
   Your screen will reflect your bright clothes.
   Even a matte display won't help if the sun will be shining on your white T-shirt.
2. Try to find a shadow.
   But try to not use trees.
   A lot of trees produce tiny drops of a resin.
   They are hard to clean from your screen.
3. Set the brightness level to the maximum.
4. Have a cleaning cloth with you. A dust is very distracting in the sun.
5. Try [hull](https://github.com/igrmk/kull-vim) theme for Vim and [Helsing](https://github.com/igrmk/helsing) theme for JetBrains products.
